I used the principle of recursion in my image to continue to add things to the design
until I felt that it was finished. Every time that I added something it needed to fall
within all of the parameters of Mondrian art, so it became more complicated as time went
on.


If I were to design a program to produce Mondrian art, I might start by allowing the user
to select the complexity of the image they wanted to produce. This would tell the program
how many times it needed to call the function responsible for drawing lines or adding color.
Each time the function to add lines ran, it would check to make sure it drew them at either
90 degree angles or parallel to what had been drawn already. When it was finished drawing,
it would add color using the random class until it was at a 2:1 ratio with whitespace.

In my opinion, the programmer should receive credit for computer art until computers are
much more advanced than they are now. Programmers still need to define the parameters for
the art that is made, so computers are never really "innovating" outside of what programmers
had intended. When computer programs can decide what art that they want to produce on their
own, possibly from them comparing human art and making their own parameters, they can
receive the credit. I wouldn't consider machine learning to be artificial intelligence yet,
but maybe as more sophisticated forms of ai become available this will be  possibility.
