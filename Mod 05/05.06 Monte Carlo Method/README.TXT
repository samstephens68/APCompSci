Good- I a big fan of squirrels, so this was a fun program for me.

Bad- Figuring out what to write to the text files was
a bit confusing at first.
************************************************
Pseudocode:
1. Ask the user how many trials they would like to run
2. check that the value is at least 1000
3. Loop the program for the value the user entered
4. Generate a new random number each iteration
5. increment the fox squirrel value approximately 1 out of 10 times
6. Write the value of the squirrel variable to a file
7. Calculate the average occurrence
8. Display the results
