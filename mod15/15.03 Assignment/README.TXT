****************PMR****************************
Good- I found the interface to be relatively simple to implement
and similar to absract classes

Bad- Nothing much, but the class view in Bluej can now get
kind of confusing sometimes
************************************************
In the future I will pay more attention to variable names and
the order of operations that they need to be in.
