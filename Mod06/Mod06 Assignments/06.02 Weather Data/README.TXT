Good- I had experimented with printf before so it made a lot of sense, 
and arrays in Java are the same as C++ so I didn't even really need
to reference the syntax ever.

Bad- I struggled to cut down on the usage of so many variables, 
and I feel like there could have been a more efficient way to write
the program but this is the only way that I could figure out how to do it

Next time I want to try to do better to write pseudocode so I
can write the program faster and more efficiently.
