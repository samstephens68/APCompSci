Good- I found this very similar to how integers and 
doubles work in C++, so it was pretty simple


Bad- I feel like it started to become confusing to
modify the project and change folders for each version

Next time I will see if there is a less confusing way
to follow the lesson than to continually copy-paste
the projects into new folders.
